Tables that need to be present in the database.

Look up table
	The maintable that's used for looking up pali words.

	dict{
		pali varchar(30); #primary key
		sin varchar(512); #look up
		new_sin varchar(512); #new additions go here
	}

Non look up table
	Only for addition of new pali words.

	new_dict{
		pali varchar(30); #primary key
		sin varchar(512);
	}

User authentication
	As of now, this table is maintained manually. The system only uses it to keep track of logins.

	auth {
		user varchar(20);
		pass varchar(128);
		temp varchar(64);
	}
Commit History

	commits {
		user varchar(20);
		pali varchar(30);
		day date;
	}
PHP files that need admin maintenance

db.php
	<?php
	    $db_user="root"; 
	    $db_name="dict";
	    $db_pass="";
	    $db_host="localhost";
	?>
